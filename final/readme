Run this in the Linux shell:
source ./test.sh

You only need to change the two variables in the shell script: TYPE (options: foot_pacing, foot_withdrawing, foot_turning_away) to use different models and VIDEO for the path to test video.
You do not need to change the line of runing python. Because 'foot_pacing.py' can test any models on any videos.
