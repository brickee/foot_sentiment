NOTE: Actually, the trial of CRF layer has failed! The outputs are indentifed to be all 1. The main contribution of this phrase is the construction and expansion of the data.
But you can still try the following step to test the model.
Step 1: Put the test video like 'DataType_testX.mark.mp4' under the 'part_6/marked/' directory.  
Step 2: Run the script with 2 parameters 'data_type' and 'test_video_file_location', like if you want to test the veido 'foot_pacing_test1.mark.mp4', just run: python foot_sentiment.py foot_pacing ./marked/foot_pacing_test1.mark.mp4
Then will get the 'DataType_pred_label_crf.png' and 'frameLabel_crf.json' files as resutls.

Models are stored in 'save' directory. Only need to pass data_type parameters to the script, it will choose the corresponding model.
